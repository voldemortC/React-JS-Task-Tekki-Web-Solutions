I have made this project using PHP as backend and phpmyadmin for my database. The technology I have used  is react and bootstrap for the frontend. This project is made using class components and REST API.

STEP 1: START APACHE AND MYSQL SERVIECES ON XAMPP / WAMP (make sure these software installed on your system)

STEP 2: MAKE DATABASE NAMED "task" IN PHPMYADMIN (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)

STEP 3: IMPORT DATABASE DUMP FILE IN PHPMYADMIN YOU WILL FIND IN task/backend/formdata.sql (inside phpmyadmin > import option > choose file formdata.sql and import it > make sure your task database have been selected)

STEP 4: TO RUN THIS PROJECT GO INSIDE task DIRECTORY AND TYPE "npm start"
